My name is Benjamin Mack.
I grew up in Swabia in south west Germany. 

I did my aternative service in lieu of military service in Solingen.
Then I lived in Bonn for many years, interrupted by one funny ERASMUS year in Granada, Spain.
After one year in Karlsruhe I came to Munich where I live ever since.

I studied in Bonn having the subjects geography, ethnology and economics.
In the end I discovered and was facinated by Remote Sensing and Earth Observation. After my studies I spent several years doing research and developement at universities, research centers and companies.
Surprisingly for myself now I work in a large reinsurance company.

I am interested in and fascinated by data. Processing and analyzing it is what I am exited about. 
I love to write code - in my early years at university mainly in R and since several years mostly in Python.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, nature, biking, reading, photography, traveling, the italina language and of course spending my time with amazing people.
